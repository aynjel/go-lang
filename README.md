# Here's a brief explanation of the key directories you'll find in this project

`cmd` This directory contains application-specific entry points (usually one per application or service). It's where you start your application.

`internal` This directory holds private application and package code. Code in this directory is not meant to be used by other projects. It's a way to enforce access control within your project.

`pkg` This directory contains public, reusable packages that can be used by other projects. Code in this directory is meant to be imported by external projects.

`api` This directory typically holds HTTP or RPC API-related code, including request handlers and middleware.

`web` If your project includes a front-end web application, this is where you'd put your assets (CSS, JavaScript, templates, etc.).

`scripts` Contains scripts for building, deploying, or maintaining the project.

`configs` Configuration files for different environments (e.g., development, production) reside here.

`tests` Holds unit and integration tests for your code.

`docs` Project documentation, such as design documents or API documentation.
